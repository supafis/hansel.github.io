Bearing health classification machine learning algorithm

This code was created on matlab aiming to classify different classes of bearing health.
The classes are:
1. Healthy bearing
2. Inner race defect
3. Outer race defect
4. Scratched ball defect
5. Combination of all defects.

The aim is to achieve an accuracy of at least 80%.
The model could be useful in industrial envrionments where bearing vibrations can be monitored and replaced ahead of its end of life.
Changing bearings early can prevent inefficiencies in machines and prevent more expensive components from failing.
